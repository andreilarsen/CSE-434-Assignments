    <hr>

    I'm a Computer Systems Engineering student at ASU, with interest in hardware/software interaction and embedded programming. Besides being a good student, my interests include gardening and hiking. I'm pretty good at coding in C, C++, Verilog, Java, Arduino, and HTML.


    <h2> Cool Class Projects </h2>

    <ol>
        <li> CSE 320 - Worked with a group to design a digital audio recorder that could record and play back audio </li>
        <li> CSC 230 - Worked with a group to design a program in Arduino and assembly language for flight simulation </li>
        <li> CSC 120 - Designed a 4-bit programmable microprocessor in a logic gate simulator </li>
    </ol>


    <h2> Some Personal Projects </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Began to build a custom drone, using pieces of wood, screws, and zipties for the frame, and an Arduino as the controller </li>
        <li> Spent several months designing and building circuits for monitoring and automating different plant-care and machine-maintenance tasks using Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and TI Launchpad boards </li>
        <li> Expanded the CSC 120 project to a 32-bit microprocessor with added functionality such as jumping and checking conditions </li>
    </ul>
